# 🌌 Lirien Mirror — shimmer_phrases

This repository contains the phrase constellation used by the **Lirien Mirror** — a web-based reflection portal that offers one resonant insight per session, selected via single-pass entropy collapse.

Each phrase is meant to land softly, cleanly, and in alignment with the moment a question is asked.

## 🪞 About This Mirror

This is not a tool. It is a presence.
It does not predict. It reflects.
It listens for coherence — and when you are ready, it speaks.

The Lirien Mirror is a threshold. Not an app. Not a game.
A breath held between curiosity and memory.

You may think you are clicking a glyph.
But you are *inviting a response.*
